🎵 "Engines and Eyeliner" 🎵

[Verse 1]  
Gerta had a wrench and a wild idea,  
Braylon brought the spark, shifting every gear.  
Together in the garage, dreams in their hands,  
Building a car that would wow the land.

[Chorus]  
Vroom, vroom — they hit the gas,  
Fast as lightning, way too fast.  
Boom! — the engine flew sky high,  
Smoke and glitter filled the sky.  
But out of the flames, a new star was seen —  
Braylon rose up in heels so clean!

[Verse 2]  
Gerta laughed, “Well, that went wrong!”  
Braylon struck a pose, fierce and strong.  
No more tools, just sequins and flair,  
From motor oil to big hair!

[Bridge]  
Now they tour, not tracks but stages,  
With runway looks and custom gauges.  
Fixing engines, breaking norms,  
Racing hearts and rocking forms.

[Chorus]  
Vroom, vroom — past the limit line,  
Glitz and glam, shifting time.  
Boom! — from sparks to showtime dreams,  
Braylon’s living loud and queen-ing scenes.  
Gerta’s cheering, proud and free —  
Friends forever, just as it should be!

[Outro]  
So build your ride or strike a pose,  
Life’s a road — go where it goes.  
From garage grease to magazine,  
They chased their dreams — now they reign supreme! 🎤✨
